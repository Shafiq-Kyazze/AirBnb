# AirBnb: Project Overview
## Brief introduction
* Airbnb is a home-sharing platform and is popular in major cities such as London, New York, Amsterdam,Barcelona. 
* Hosts set a price when listing their houses on the platform
* Due to heavy business competition in major cities, it is important for a business to set the right price for a product because a small difference in price could result in losing customers to your competitors.
* AirBnb hosts have to endure this stiff competition hence the need to set the best price inorder to get more customers as well as providing the best customer service
## Project Aims
The project will look at meeting the following goals:
1. Which areas are mainly flocked by guests?
2. Why are some hosts are busier than others?
3. Why do guests highly rate some properties?
4. Clean the dataset and prepare it for exploration and prediction
4. Explore the dataset to find interesting relationships between.
5. To predict the rent price of homes listed using machnine learning and deep learning
6. To meet other project aims using a dataset from one of the following major cities: London, NewYork, Paris, San Francisco, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin.
